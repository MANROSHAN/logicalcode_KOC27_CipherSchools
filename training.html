        <font color="red" size="5" face="georgia">
            
            Building and maintaining muscle is necessary for all of us, especially as we age. And the earlier we start, the better.
            
            According to the American Council on Exercise, most adults lose nearly a half pound of muscle per year starting around age 30, mostly 
            because they aren't as active as they were when they were younger. Losing muscle at the same time that metabolism starts to slow down 
            is a recipe for weight gain and the health issues that can accompany it.

            Building stronger muscles isn't just about vanity, either. According to the Mayo Clinic, strength training not only helps with weight 
            control, but also stops bone loss and can even build new bone.
            
            This can reduce the risk of fractures from osteoporosis. It also improves balance and boosts energy levels.
            
            A significant amount of evidence exists to support the overall health benefits of strength training. And there's been some quite 
            convincing research on the subject recently:
            
            A study published in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Preventionsuggested that the more muscle men have, the lower their risk of 
            death from cancer.A studyTrusted Source published in BMJsuggested that weight training can improve long-term balance in older adult
            -s.A 2017 study in the Journal of EndocrinologyTrusted Source suggested that having muscle can improve insulin sensitivity and glucose 
            tolerance. </font>
            

            <font color="blue" size="5" face="algerian"><u>How much weight is best? </u></font>
       
            <font color="red" size="5" face="georgia">
            
            The amount of weight you use depends on how many repetitions you're aiming for. You want to lift enough weight so that the last 
            repetition is really tough and you feel like you couldn't do one more. Naturally, you'll need to use a heavier dumbbell for 6 repetitions 
            than you will for 12, even though you're doing the same exercise.

            Never lift so much weight that it causes pain. You are better off lifting too little than too much as your body gets used to 
            weight training. Also, unless you are working out with a spotter, use machines with safety stops in place to prevent injury.</font>

            <font color="red" size="5" face="georgia">   
            
            Warm up.

            Some aerobic activity, such as a 5-minute jog or brisk walk, will increase blood flow to your muscles and prime them for a good 
            workout. Skipping rope or doing jumping jacks for a few minutes are also good warmup options.
                
            2. Start with lighter weights. 
                
            You want to start with a weight that you can lift 10 to 15 times with proper form. Begin with 1 or 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions, 
            and slowly progress to 3 sets or more.
                
            3. Gradually increase the weight. 
                
            When you can easily do the recommended number of sets and reps, increase the weight by 5 to 10 percent. Check to make sure this is 
            the right weight for you before doing a full workout.
                
            4. Rest for at least 60 seconds in between sets. 

            This helps prevent muscle fatigue, especially as you start out.
                
            5. Limit your workout to no longer than 45 minutes. 
                
            You can get the workout you need in this time frame. Longer sessions may not lead to better results and may increase your risk of 
            burnout and muscle fatigue.This helps prevent muscle fatigue, especially as you start out.
                
            6. Gently stretch your muscles after your workout. 
                
            Stretching can help boost your flexibility, ease muscle tension, and reduce your risk of injury.
                
            7. Rest a day or two in between workouts. 
                
            Resting gives your muscles time to recover and replenish energy stores before your next workout.</font>

            Start off by doing 10 to 15 reps of each exercise. Aim for 1 to 2 sets to start. As you build strength, you can add extra sets, and also 
            increase the weight.
                
            What is a rep? A repetition (rep) is one complete exercise movement.
            What is a set? A set is a certain number of reps. For instance, 10 to 15 reps make up 1 set.</font>
